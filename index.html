		<div id="intro">
			<p>Jonson is STILL a man of little to no talent. The one and only thing he is good at, is being illegal. His factory(s) on Jupiter are thriving and raking him in an unfathomable amount of money. The police have caught onto him, however he simply used his wealth to buy the police, as well as every government in the universe. The torment and torture he puts his workers through is unlike anything you've ever heard of, and this sequel to the original & succesful JNSN Crimes, will tell you all about what happens to these workers, as well as a few of his lighter crimes.</p>
